# BRIAN RUSH PROGRAMMING PORTFOLIO

#### _Portfolio landing page showcasing Brian Rush's programming projects, 4.21.2017_

#### By _**Brian Rush**_

## Description

_Created for an assignment / independent project for Epicodus code school, this website showcases some of Brian Rush's programming projects, all of which, at this time, were also created as part of my Epicodus studies. The focus of these projects was learning the tools, techniques, and knowledge necessary to be a successful front-end programmer; the focus, at least at this point (April 2017), has not been on beautiful, finished products_
